# Gamor Streaming Platform

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a website for the game streaming platform "Gamor". The main objective of the layout work will be to evaluate the candidates' skills with HTML and CSS. Therefore, no UI library or framework can be used.

## Website Sections

The website consists of the following sections:
- Home page
- Navbar (with links to the application's registration and login)
- Main Section (Main Board)
- Categories Section
- Authentication Page (Login)
    - No design is provided for this page, the candidate must provide one when delivering the exercise.
- Registration Page
    - This page will not be evaluated, it should not be laid out, only the links should appear on the main page.

## Functional Elements

The site must be functional with data stored statically or using a cloud tool like Twitch. The functional elements will be as follows:
- Authentication
- Website theme change
- Game search
    - In this session, you should be able to search for games that match the applied filters.
    - When clicking on the plus sign in the search panel, the user will be added to the center panel.

## Note

The layout must be presented using the Dark and Light themes provided in the video.

## Technical Requirements
